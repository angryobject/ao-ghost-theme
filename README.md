A theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) intended to be used on my blog. Basically, the default Casper theme with some color changes. Probably you don't want to use it because there're many free *beautiful* themes [out there](http://marketplace.ghost.org/themes/free/). I just put it here for myself. But if you do - don't forget to change the GA script in `default.hbs`.
